## Highlight of project and reproducible results


In this project, the objective was to reproduce specific figures and tables from the FiveThirtyEight website. The chosen focus was on reproducing content from the article titled "How Americans Like Their Steak" on the FiveThirtyEight website [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-like-their-steak/]. The project successfully accomplished the goal of reproducing both a table and a figure from the original content. The forthcoming details will provide a comprehensive explanation of the construction process for the table and the generation of the figure, highlighting the accuracy and fidelity in replicating the intended output.





## Packages

The project initiation involves loading essential packages to facilitate various tasks. These include:

* readr: This package is utilized for proficiently loading and reading data, ensuring the successful importation of the required dataset.

* kableExtra: This package plays a crucial role in constructing and formatting tables, providing enhanced capabilities for table customization.

* ggplot2: Utilized for creating plots, ggplot2 is an influential package that contributes to the visualization aspect of the project.

* dplyr: This package is essential for data manipulation and transformation, providing functionalities to streamline data processing tasks.

By incorporating these packages into the project, it sets the foundation for effective data handling, table construction, and plot generation throughout the subsequent phases.
```{r}
# libraries loaded
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data Loading

Next, the dataset, available on the provided GitHub repository link https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/steak-survey/steak-risk-survey.csv, is essential for the project. The codes below involve specifying the URL of the dataset and utilizing the read_csv function from the readr package to read the data into the R environment. The skip = 1 parameter is used to skip the first row during the import process.The following codes can be used to successfully read the data into R:

```{r}
# Specify the URL of the dataset on GitHub
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/steak-survey/steak-risk-survey.csv"

# Read the data into R using readr
steak_risk_survey <- readr::read_csv(data_url, skip = 1)

```

## Reproduce Table

My first goal is to reproduce the table summarizing people's risk and how they liked their steak cooked. In the survey, people were asked “Consider the following hypothetical situations: In Lottery A, you have a 50 percent chance of success, with a payout of $\$100$. In Lottery B, you have a 90 percent chance of success, with a payout of $\$20$. Assuming you have $\$10$ to bet, would you play Lottery A or Lottery B?” The survey revealed that respondents perceived "Lottery A" as the riskier lottery based on their responses. This distinction is explicitly captured in the dataset through the data column labeled "Response_2," which serves as a record of responses from individuals who made choices between Lottery A and Lottery B. Additionally, the survey documented participants' steak preferences, encompassing five distinct categories: Well, Medium-well, Medium, Medium-rare, and Rare. These steak preferences were recorded in the data column labeled "Response_10," providing insights into the varied ways individuals prefer their steak to be cooked. 

```{r}

  
 steak_Response2_Response_10 =c(steak_risk_survey$Response...2,steak_risk_survey $Response...10)

 
 percentage_table<- table(steak_risk_survey$Response...2,steak_risk_survey $Response...10)

 #calculate proportion 
 percentages<- prop.table(percentage_table,margin=1)*100
 
 #transpose table and round percentages to one decimal place
  percentages<-t(round(percentages,1))
  
# rename rows and columns
  colnames(percentages)<-c("RESPONDENTS WHO CHOSE THE RISKIER LOTTERY","RESPONDENTS WHO CHOSE THE SAFER LOTTERY")
  
  rownames(percentages)<-c("Medium","Medium-rare","Medium-well","Rare","Well")
 
  
# Shuffle the rows
percentages_shuffled <- percentages[c("Well","Medium-well","Medium","Medium-rare","Rare"), ]

# Display the modified and shuffled percentage table
kable(percentages_shuffled, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  add_header_above(c("STEAK PREFERENCE", " " = 1, " "), bold = TRUE, line = "solid")
```


# Reproduce figure 
Afterwards, I created a horizontal bar plot to show how people preferred their steak. The results matched what the original author found, with around 69% of participants liking their steak cooked to a medium level. Interestingly, the plot revealed that there were about twice as many people who preferred medium-rare compared to those who liked it medium-well. This similarity in results indicates that my results accurately reflects the original findings.



```{r}
# Calculate total number of respondents
total <- sum(table(steak_risk_survey$Response...10))

# Counts for each steak preference
counts <- table(steak_risk_survey$Response...10)

# Steak Preferences
steak_Preference <- c("Medium", "Medium-rare", "Medium-Well", "Rare", "Well")

# Calculate percentages of steak preferences
percentages <- round(counts / total * 100)

# Create a data frame with steak preferences and percentages
data_preference <- data.frame(steak_Preference, percentages)

# Create a horizontal bar plot without axis or coordinate labels
ggp <- ggplot(data_preference, aes(x = percentages, y = steak_Preference, fill = steak_Preference)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#8B4513", "#A0522D", "#CD853F", "#D2B48C", "#DEB887")) +  
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none") +  # Remove unnecessary elements
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(percentages, "%")), hjust = -0.2) +  # Print percentages on bars 
  labs(title = "How Do You Like Your Steak Prepared?")  # Flip coordinates

print(ggp)


```
